# CS330

How do I approach designing software?
For this project, I began by breaking the full 3D scene into smaller parts: the table, monitors, lamp, objects, walls, and lights. I sketched out the scene layout conceptually and thought about how objects should be positioned and scaled in 3D space. My approach focused a lot on planning the structure first, then implementing and adjusting visuals through iterative refinement in code.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I developed a better understanding of 3D object organization, camera angles, and scene composition. I learned how small touches like angled lights, object placement, and texturingâ€”can make a virtual scene feel so much more real. I also practiced layering objects logically using OpenGL transformations like translation, scaling, and rotation.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started with a basic table and added objects step-by-step, including dual monitors, a lamp, a mug, and a mouse. I made the design more real with lighting and background wall texture. As I progressed, I continuously refined positioning, lighting angles, and object scaling to make the scene more immersive and realistic. Once the scene was mostly complete, I focused on subtle improvements like adjusting the brightness of lights.
